        <h3>About the Product</h3>
        <p>Straight staircases are the most efficient and the simplest to construct, as they have fewer parts than other designs. They are also less prone to accidents due to their straightforward design, as there are no turns or landings that could catch someoneâ€™s foot.
Additionally, straight staircases are space-saving and can be installed in places where space is limited. They are also usually the most cost-effective choice.</p>
